    "\n",
    "In this lab we are going to look at Long Short Term Memories (LSTMs). In the lecture we saw how LSTMs can be applied to regression problems, and in this lab we look at how to use LSTMs as generators to produce stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Important warning: Don't expect the stories to be of any usable quality. It will barely be readable. This is because we are using a very small dataset and a relatively simple network</b>\n",

    "We start first by looking at how to generate stories using an LSTM.  To do so we need to do two important things with the text:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
